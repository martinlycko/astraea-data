re you interested in building dashboards to allow an Investment Manager to interpret and analyse their ESG data?



You will be working directly with the senior stakeholders in the firm to understand what insights they are looking to gain, then build reports and dashboards using SQL and PowerBI.



Alongside this, you’ll spend the other half of your time analysing the ESG data and markets, looking for ways you can influence and impact the firm’s performance.



This is a relatively junior role, so while you may have some experience with PowerBI, Tableau or SSRS, this is an opportunity to develop those skills further and progress into a Senior position over the next few years.



The Investment Manager has roughly $110 billion AUM and has been identified as one of the fastest growing globally over the last year – which will provide even more opportunities for progression within the role.
